**Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS**

## What is this book about?
The area of robotics is gaining huge momentum among corporate people, researchers, hobbyists, and students. The major challenge in robotics is its controlling software. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a modular software platform to develop generic robotic applications.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Create a robot model with a 7-DOF robotic arm and a differential wheeled mobile robot
* Work with Gazebo, CoppeliaSim, and Webots robotic simulators
* Implement autonomous navigation in differential drive robots using SLAM and AMCL packages
* Interact with and simulate aerial robots using ROS
* Explore ROS pluginlib, ROS nodelets, and Gazebo plugins
* Interface I/O boards such as Arduino, robot sensors, and high-end actuators
* Simulate and perform motion planning for an ABB robot and a universal arm using ROS-Industrial
* Work with the motion planning features of a 7-DOF arm using MoveIt

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
void number_callback(const std_msgs::Int32::ConstPtr& msg) { 
 ROS_INFO("Received [%d]",msg->data); 
} 
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a robotics graduate, robotics researcher, or robotics software professional looking to work with ROS, this book is for you. Programmers who want to explore the advanced features of ROS will also find this book useful. Basic knowledge of ROS, GNU/Linux, and C++ programming concepts is necessary to get started with this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-16).
